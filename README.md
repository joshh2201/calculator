# calculator

Welcome to my calculator project using Javascript, HTML, and CSS!

To get started, simply open the index.html file in your browser. You will be presented with a calculator interface, which allows you to input numbers using the buttons on the screen and perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The calculator can also handle decimals, and you can delete numbers from the display if you want to edit your input.

The project leverages Javascript objects, event listeners, and DOM manipulation to create a functional and interactive calculator.

I hope you enjoy using the calculator project! Feedback and questions are welcome and encouraged!
